# roz.ai - Your Personal AI Assistant

roz.ai is a personal AI assistant tool built using Flask, Google Gemini API, and SQLite. It allows you to engage in conversational AI, upload and summarize files, integrate with Google Calendar, and perform web searches to enhance the AI's responses.

This is mostly an experiment in how far AI coding can take us. Aiming for as close to 100% of this code to be generated by AI tools. Using Aider and this web app itself to generate and manage code and features.

## Technologies Used

*   **Flask:**  A lightweight Python web framework.
*   **Google Gemini API:** For AI-powered conversation and content generation.
*   **SQLite:**  A self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine.
*   **Tailwind CSS:**  A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
*   **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** For the front-end interface.

## Prerequisites

*   **Python 3.8+**
*   **pip** (Python package installer)
*   **Google Gemini API Key:** You will need a valid API key from Google. Obtain one [here](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey).
*   **Google API Credentials (Optional for Google Calendar and Voice Transcription):** Instructions on obtaining this are outside the scope of this README.  For voice transcription, you'll need to enable the Cloud Speech-to-Text API and create a service account with appropriate permissions. Ensure the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable points to your service account key file.
*   **Google Cloud Storage Bucket (Optional for Long Voice Transcription):** Create a Google Cloud Storage bucket to store audio files for long-running transcription. Set the GCS_BUCKET_NAME environment variable to the name of your bucket.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd roz.ai
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure environment variables:**

    *   Create a `.env` file in the project root directory.
    *   Add the following variables to the `.env` file:

        ```
        SECRET_KEY=<your_secret_key>  # Generate a strong, random key
        GEMINI_API_KEY=<your_gemini_api_key>
        # Optional Google API variables:
        GOOGLE_API_KEY=<your_google_api_key>
        GOOGLE_CSE_ID=<your_google_cse_id>
        GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=<path_to_your_google_service_account_key.json> # Required for voice transcription

You can modify these options by editing the `app/config.py` file or setting the corresponding environment variables.

## Database Structure

The application uses an SQLite database with the following tables:

*   `chats`: Stores chat session information (id, name, created\_at, last\_updated\_at, model\_name).
